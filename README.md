SMS/Email Spam Classifier
Overview
This project involves the creation of a machine learning model to classify SMS and email messages as either "spam" or "ham" (non-spam). The goal is to build an efficient and accurate classifier to filter out unwanted messages.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for training.
Feature Extraction: Converting text data into numerical features using techniques like TF-IDF.
Model Training: Using algorithms like Naive Bayes, SVM, and others to train the classifier.
Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Requirements
Python 3.7+
Libraries:
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
nltk
matplotlib (for optional visualizations)
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/spam-classifier.git
cd spam-classifier
Install the required libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Data Preparation
Place your dataset in the data/ directory. Ensure it has columns text and label, where label is either 'spam' or 'ham'.
Preprocess the data:
python
Copy code
from preprocessing import preprocess_data
data = preprocess_data('data/dataset.csv')
Feature Extraction
Convert the text data into numerical features:
python
Copy code
from feature_extraction import extract_features
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = extract_features(data)
Model Training and Evaluation
Train the model:

python
Copy code
from model import train_model
model = train_model(X_train, y_train)
Evaluate the model:

python
Copy code
from evaluation import evaluate_model
evaluate_model(model, X_test, y_test)
